# Approximating-Irrational-Triangles
Abstract: This research examines the approximation of quadratic-irrational right triangles represented by the triple (𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾) with 𝛼2 + 𝛽2 = 𝛾2 . I prove that there exists a characteristic equation 𝑝𝛼 + 𝑞𝛽 − 𝑟𝛾 = 0 with 𝑝,𝑞, and 𝑟 being  integers which encompasses the ratios of sides in the triangle. 

What we are looking at is quadratic irrational points, points (x,y) such that x and y are both quadratic irrational numbers (see more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_irrational_number). These points can be translated onto the unit circle to create right triangles. The triangles help us visualize how quadratic irrational points approximate rational ones. We imagine a quadratic irrational triangle (one that was translated from a point) growing larger and larger until it's ratio of it's sides get closer and closer to it's rational equivalent. These rational equivalents already exist because they can be produced via berggren trees. Take a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_primitive_Pythagorean_triples

I conducted this research under Professor Byungchul Cha by generating a few examples, understanding the characteristic equation he proposed, and presenting all results at Mathfest 2023 in Tampa, FL.
